## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
#Function does the following
#create a matrix and store
#calculate the inverse of the matrix and store it
# get the stored matrix inverse (if not already calculated)

## This function creates the matrix, inverts it and caches matrix and its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the matrix that is returned above 
# IF it hasn't been computed already. If so, it just gets it from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
